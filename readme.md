## Some kind of Parser in Javascript

**
Found these files those I wrote long ago attempting to make a parser for a **custom language similar to JS**. It's been a while since I abandoned this project. Have to clean up my disk so decided to push these into GitHub as a memory.

edit the `code.xs` file to change it's contents. It's the input.

Run the `Tester.js` file using `node ./Tester.js`

(You'll need NodeJS to run this!)

The output AST will be saved to `tree.json`
